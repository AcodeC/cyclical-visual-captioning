## How to start

Clone the repo recursively:

```shell
git clone --recursive git@github.com:chihyaoma/cyclical-visual-captioning.git
```

If you didn't clone with the --recursive flag, then you'll need to manually clone the pybind submodule from the top-level directory:

```shell
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

## Installation

The proposed cyclical method can be applied directly to image and video captioning tasks.

Currently, installation guide and our code for video captioning on the ActivityNet-Entities dataset are provided in [anet-video-captioning](anet-video-captioning).
